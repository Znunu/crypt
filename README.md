# crypt
Various algorithms that operate on/with a ring of integers modulo n. Useful for cryptography.

- EEA: Extended Euclidean Algorithm 
- GRC: Chinese Remainder Algorithm
- SOE: Sieve of Eratosthenes
- LCG: Linear Congruntial Generator
- RSA: Public-Key Encryption
- DH:  Key Exchange

#TODO: Implement ECC. Apparently the discrete logarithm problem is harder for the group of elliptic curve points than integers modulo prime
